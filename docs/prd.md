### Enhancement Scope Definition

#### Enhancement Type

- ☑️ Technology Stack Upgrade (complete platform migration)

#### Enhancement Description

Migrate the existing Mattermost Electron application from vendor/desktop to a new cross-platform architecture using Expo + Tauri. This involves migrating from Electron to Tauri for desktop functionality, transitioning from SCSS to Unistyles for styling, and updating the internationalization system from react-intl to i18next. The Expo framework enables future mobile expansion with native apps while providing react-native-web static output for desktop (Tauri-wrapped) and web deployments.

#### Impact Assessment

- ☑️ Major Impact (architectural changes required)

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals

- Migrate from Electron to Expo + Tauri for better performance and smaller bundle size
- Enable future mobile platform support through Expo native apps (iOS/Android)
- Establish unified codebase with react-native-web static output for desktop and web platforms
- Replace SCSS with Unistyles for better TypeScript integration and cross-platform styling
- Modernize internationalization with i18next ecosystem
- Eliminate legacy and dead code during migration
- Migrate platform-specific APIs from Node.js to Rust (via Tauri)

#### Background Context

The current Mattermost Electron application has accumulated technical debt and legacy code that makes maintenance difficult. A complete platform migration to Expo + Tauri offers the opportunity to modernize the tech stack, reduce bundle size, improve performance, and establish a cleaner codebase. Tauri's Rust-based backend will provide better security and performance compared to the current Node.js Electron approach.

Expo was chosen as the foundation framework because it provides a unified development experience across platforms: native mobile apps (iOS/Android) for optimal performance, and react-native-web with static output for desktop (wrapped with Tauri) and web deployments. This approach maximizes code sharing while delivering platform-appropriate user experiences.
