# Story 1.6: Environment Variable Management with Flutter DotEnv - Brownfield Addition

## Status

**Done**

## User Story

As a **developer**,
I want **to manage environment-specific configuration through .env files with type-safe access and validation**,
So that **I can easily configure different settings for development, staging, and production environments with compile-time safety and runtime validation**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing flavor system and bootstrap process
- Technology: Flutter/Dart with existing flavor pattern (development, staging, production)
- Follows pattern: Current flavor-based configuration in `lib/flavors/` directory
- Touch points: `bootstrap.dart`, flavor entry points, app initialization

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. flutter_dotenv package is added to pubspec.yaml dependencies
2. Environment files (.env.development, .env.staging, .env.production) can be loaded per flavor
3. Environment variables are accessible throughout the app after bootstrap
4. Environment variables use json_serializable for type-safe parsing
5. Required variables throw clear errors if missing (enforced by json_serializable)
6. All environment access through type-safe ENV global object
7. Code generation handles validation and type conversion automatically

**Integration Requirements:**
8. Existing flavor system (development, staging, production) continues to work unchanged
9. New environment loading follows existing bootstrap pattern in `bootstrap.dart`
10. Integration with current app initialization maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**
11. Change is covered by appropriate tests
12. Assets configuration is updated to include .env files
13. No regression in existing flavor functionality verified

## Dev Notes

### Current Bootstrap Architecture

The bootstrap process in `lib/bootstrap.dart` currently:

- Sets up FlutterError handling
- Initializes AppBlocObserver for debugging
- Calls `await RustLib.init()` for Rust library initialization
- Runs the app via `runApp(await builder())`

**Integration Point**: Add dotenv loading after RustLib.init() and before runApp().

### Existing Flavor System

The project uses 3 flavors with separate entry points:

- `lib/flavors/main_development.dart`
- `lib/flavors/main_staging.dart`
- `lib/flavors/main_production.dart`

Each flavor calls `bootstrap(App.new)` - the flavor detection must happen within bootstrap.dart.

**Flavor Detection Mechanism (Architecture Decision):**

Use static flavor registry pattern with explicit flavor setting in each entry point:

```dart
// lib/flavors/flavor_config.dart
enum AppFlavor { development, staging, production }

class FlavorConfig {
  static AppFlavor? _currentFlavor;

  static void setFlavor(AppFlavor flavor) {
    _currentFlavor = flavor;
  }

  static AppFlavor get currentFlavor =>
    _currentFlavor ?? AppFlavor.development;

  static String get flavorName => currentFlavor.name;
}
```

Modified flavor entry points will explicitly set their flavor before calling bootstrap:

```dart
// lib/flavors/main_development.dart
import 'package:skiffy/flavors/flavor_config.dart';

void main() {
  FlavorConfig.setFlavor(AppFlavor.development);
  bootstrap(App.new);
}
```

Bootstrap integration (cascading configuration):

```dart
// In bootstrap.dart - add after bloc observer setup
// Load base configuration first, then flavor-specific overrides
await dotenv.load(fileName: '.env'); // Common variables
await dotenv.load(fileName: '.env.${FlavorConfig.flavorName}', mergeWith: dotenv.env); // Flavor overrides
```

**Environment File Strategy:**

- `.env` - Common variables shared across all flavors (base API endpoints, feature flags, etc.)
- `.env.development` - Development-specific overrides (debug URLs, test credentials)
- `.env.staging` - Staging-specific overrides (staging endpoints, staging keys)
- `.env.production` - Production-specific overrides (production URLs, production keys)

Variables in flavor-specific files override those in the base `.env` file.

### Project Structure Context

- **Dependencies**: Currently uses flutter_rust_bridge, no conflicting env management
- **Assets**: Located in `assets/` directory, current assets configuration in pubspec.yaml includes `assets/images/icons/`
- **Testing**: Existing test structure in `test/` with design system tests as examples

### Critical Constraints

- **Maintain RustLib initialization order**: Environment loading must not interfere with Rust library setup
- **Preserve bloc observer**: Existing debugging setup must remain functional
- **No breaking changes**: All existing flavor functionality must continue working unchanged

### Testing

- **Test Location**: Add tests in `test/bootstrap/` directory
- **Test Framework**: Use existing flutter_test framework (already in dev_dependencies)
- **Test Types**: Unit tests for bootstrap env loading, integration tests for flavor-specific loading
- **Existing Pattern**: Follow pattern from `test/app/design_system/` tests for structure

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend the existing bootstrap process to load appropriate .env file based on flavor
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow the flavor-specific entry point pattern in `lib/flavors/main_*.dart`
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain compatibility with existing Rust library initialization and bloc observer setup

## Definition of Done

- [x] flutter_dotenv dependency added to pubspec.yaml
- [x] .env files created for each flavor (development, staging, production)
- [x] Bootstrap process updated to load appropriate .env file
- [x] Environment variables accessible via DotEnv.env throughout app
- [x] Assets configuration includes .env files
- [x] Existing flavor functionality regression tested
- [x] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [x] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [x] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Breaking existing app initialization or flavor switching
- **Mitigation:** Add env loading after existing RustLib.init() in bootstrap
- **Rollback:** Remove flutter_dotenv dependency and env loading code

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [x] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [x] UI changes follow existing design patterns (N/A)
- [x] Performance impact is negligible

## Implementation Details

### Package Integration

- Add `flutter_dotenv: ^5.1.0` to pubspec.yaml dependencies
- Add `json_annotation: ^4.8.1` to dependencies
- Add `json_serializable: ^6.7.1` and `build_runner: ^2.4.9` to dev_dependencies
- Include .env files in assets configuration

### Environment Files Structure

```
.env                  # Base configuration (shared variables)
.env.development     # Development overrides
.env.staging         # Staging overrides
.env.production      # Production overrides
```

### Bootstrap Integration

Extend the existing bootstrap function to load environment variables based on the current flavor before app initialization.

### Access Pattern

Environment variables will be accessible via type-safe `ENV.variableName` throughout the application after bootstrap completion. The global `ENV` object is validated during bootstrap using json_serializable parsing.

**Example Usage:**

```dart
// Type-safe access (no magic strings)
if (ENV.enableDebugLogs) {
  print('Debug enabled');
}

final apiUrl = ENV.apiBaseUrl; // guaranteed non-null
```

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

### Debug Log References

- Discovered flutter_dotenv uses "first wins" behavior (not "last wins" as typical env vars)

8. **Completed json_serializable integration** with proper type-safe validation and defaults
9. **Global ENV instance implemented** for type-safe access throughout the app
10. **Fixed asset generation conflicts** by configuring flutter_gen to exclude .env files
