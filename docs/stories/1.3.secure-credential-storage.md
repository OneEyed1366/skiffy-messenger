# Story 1.3: Secure Credential Storage Implementation

**As a** developer,
**I want to** implement a cross-platform secure storage mechanism,
**so that** sensitive user credentials (tokens, keys) are protected using native OS capabilities.

---

## Status: Completed

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A `SecureStorage` trait is defined in the Rust core, abstracting `set`, `get`, and `delete` operations.
2. A platform-specific implementation for macOS/iOS is created using the `security-framework` crate to interact with the Keychain.
3. A platform-specific implementation for Windows is created using the `keyring` crate to interact with the Credential Manager.
4. A platform-specific implementation for Linux is created using the `keyring` crate to interact with the Secret Service API.
5. A secure fallback mechanism is implemented: If the Linux implementation fails to find a secret service, it defaults to an in-memory-only storage.
6. The Rust core can detect the fallback scenario and reports a "session-not-persistent" status via the FFI layer.
7. The Flutter UI displays a non-intrusive warning to the user when the "session-not-persistent" status is active.
8. Sensitive data is never written to unencrypted files or the local SQLite database.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

[Source: docs/stories/story-1.2-matrix-sdk-integration.md]

- Authentication flow needs to be integrated with SecureStorage for credentials
- Matrix SDK integration completed with MatrixClient struct
- MatrixClient methods available: new, login, send_message, sync, get_user_info, is_logged_in
- All methods exposed via flutter_rust_bridge auto-generated FFI layer

### Platform-Specific Secure Storage Implementation

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#platform-specific-integrations]

**iOS**:

- Use Keychain for secure credential storage
- Native integration available

**Android**:

- Use Credential Manager for secure storage
- Foreground Service for background sync (dataSync type)

**Desktop Secure Storage**:

- **macOS**: Keychain
- **Windows**: Credential Manager
- **Linux**: Secret Service API

### Rust Dependencies and Architecture

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-stack-rust-core]

**Required Dependencies** (add to Cargo.toml):

```toml
# Platform-specific secure storage
[target.'cfg(any(target_os = "macos", target_os = "ios"))'.dependencies]
security-framework = "2.9"

[target.'cfg(target_os = "windows")'.dependencies]
keyring = { version = "2.0", features = ["windows"] }

[target.'cfg(target_os = "linux")'.dependencies]
keyring = { version = "2.0", features = ["linux"] }

# Async runtime (already present)
tokio = { version = "1.35", features = ["full"] }

# Error handling (already present)
anyhow = "1.0"
thiserror = "1.0"
```

**File Locations** [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#rust-core-structure]:

```
rust/src/
├── core/
│   └── storage/
│       ├── mod.rs           # SecureStorage trait definition
│       ├── keychain.rs      # macOS/iOS implementation
│       ├── windows.rs       # Windows implementation
│       ├── linux.rs         # Linux implementation
│       ├── memory.rs        # Fallback implementation
│       └── factory.rs       # Platform factory
├── api/
│   └── secure_storage.rs    # FFI API surface
```

### Error Handling Pattern

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#rust-standards]

- Use Result type with anyhow for error handling
- Define custom error types with thiserror
- Never use unwrap/expect - use proper error propagation
- Add contextual error messages with .context()

### FFI Bridge Requirements

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#ffi-bridge-standards]

- Use simple types for FFI boundary
- Create DTOs for data transfer
- Map internal errors to FFI-safe error types
- All FFI functions must be async-compatible

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

**Test File Locations**:

- Unit tests: `rust/src/core/storage/tests/`
- Integration tests: `rust/tests/integration/storage/`
- Flutter tests: `test/services/secure_storage_test.dart`

**Testing Standards**:

- Use `#[tokio::test]` for async tests
- Mock external dependencies (Keychain, Credential Manager, Secret Service)
- Test error scenarios and fallback behavior
- Minimum 80% test coverage
- Use `#[cfg(test)]` modules for test utilities

**Testing Patterns**:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_secure_storage_operations() {
        // Test implementation
    }
}
```

### Security Considerations

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#security-standards]

- Never log sensitive data in Debug implementations
- Use secure random generation where needed
- Validate all inputs at FFI boundary
- Ensure credentials are properly zeroized when dropped

### Flutter Integration

[Source: architecture/project-structure.md#flutter-application-structure]

**Service Location**: `lib/services/storage_service.dart`
**BLoC Location**: `lib/features/auth/bloc/` (integrate with existing AuthBloc)
**Widget Location**: `lib/widgets/app_notification_banner.dart`

**Flutter Dependencies** (already available):

- BLoC pattern for state management
- Service layer for FFI integration

### Conditional Compilation

```rust
#[cfg(any(target_os = "macos", target_os = "ios"))]
mod keychain;

#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
mod windows;

#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]
mod linux;
```

### Testing

**Test Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]:

- Unit tests must cover all SecureStorage trait implementations
- Integration tests for platform-specific storage backends
- Flutter tests for UI warning behavior
- Mock external platform APIs for deterministic testing
- Test both success and failure scenarios for each platform
- Test the fallback mechanism on Linux when Secret Service is unavailable

**Test File Structure**:

```
rust/src/core/storage/
├── tests/
│   ├── trait_tests.rs       # SecureStorage trait tests
│   ├── keychain_tests.rs    # macOS/iOS tests
│   ├── windows_tests.rs     # Windows tests
│   ├── linux_tests.rs       # Linux tests
│   └── fallback_tests.rs    # Fallback behavior tests

test/services/
└── secure_storage_service_test.dart # Flutter service tests
```

**Testing Framework**: Use built-in Rust test framework with tokio::test for async operations and mockito/wiremock for mocking platform APIs where possible.
