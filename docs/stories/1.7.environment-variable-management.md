# Story 1.7: Environment Variable Management with Flutter DotEnv - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **developer**,
I want **to manage environment-specific configuration through .env files using flutter_dotenv**,
So that **I can easily configure different settings for development, staging, and production environments without hardcoding values**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing flavor system and bootstrap process
- Technology: Flutter/Dart with existing flavor pattern (development, staging, production)
- Follows pattern: Current flavor-based configuration in `lib/flavors/` directory
- Touch points: `bootstrap.dart`, flavor entry points, app initialization

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. flutter_dotenv package is added to pubspec.yaml dependencies
2. Environment files (.env.development, .env.staging, .env.production) can be loaded per flavor
3. Environment variables are accessible throughout the app after bootstrap

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing flavor system (development, staging, production) continues to work unchanged
5. New environment loading follows existing bootstrap pattern in `bootstrap.dart`
6. Integration with current app initialization maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Change is covered by appropriate tests
8. Assets configuration is updated to include .env files
9. No regression in existing flavor functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend the existing bootstrap process to load appropriate .env file based on flavor
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow the flavor-specific entry point pattern in `lib/flavors/main_*.dart`
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain compatibility with existing Rust library initialization and bloc observer setup

## Definition of Done

- [ ] flutter_dotenv dependency added to pubspec.yaml
- [ ] .env files created for each flavor (development, staging, production)
- [ ] Bootstrap process updated to load appropriate .env file
- [ ] Environment variables accessible via DotEnv.env throughout app
- [ ] Assets configuration includes .env files
- [ ] Existing flavor functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Breaking existing app initialization or flavor switching
- **Mitigation:** Add env loading after existing RustLib.init() in bootstrap
- **Rollback:** Remove flutter_dotenv dependency and env loading code

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [x] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [x] UI changes follow existing design patterns (N/A)
- [x] Performance impact is negligible

## Implementation Details

### Package Integration

- Add `flutter_dotenv: ^5.1.0` to pubspec.yaml dependencies
- Include .env files in assets configuration

### Environment Files Structure

```
.env.development
.env.staging
.env.production
```

### Bootstrap Integration

Extend the existing bootstrap function to load environment variables based on the current flavor before app initialization.

### Access Pattern

Environment variables will be accessible via `DotEnv.env['VARIABLE_NAME']` throughout the application after bootstrap completion.
